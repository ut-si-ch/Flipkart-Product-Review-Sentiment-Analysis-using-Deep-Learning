# Flipkart Product Review Sentiment Analysis using Deep Learning

## ðŸ§¾ Overview

This project uses a **Deep Learning-based NLP model** to analyze customer reviews from Flipkart and classify them into positive or negative sentiments. The model is built using **Keras with TensorFlow backend**, showcasing how deep learning can be applied to real-world text classification problems.

## ðŸ§  Business Understanding

In e-commerce platforms like Flipkart, understanding customer sentiment is crucial for:
- Identifying product performance and customer satisfaction
- Enhancing user experience
- Flagging negative trends early
- Improving recommendations and marketing

Manual review analysis is infeasible at scale â€” hence, an automated sentiment classifier is highly valuable.

## ðŸ“Š Data Understanding

The dataset includes:
- Customer-written **review texts**
- Corresponding **star ratings** (used to infer sentiment)

### Preprocessing:
- Text normalization (lowercasing, punctuation removal)
- Stopword removal
- Tokenization and padding for LSTM input
- Label creation: binary sentiment (`positive` vs `negative`) from ratings
